# REST-assured API Testing Project

This project is designed to demonstrate automated testing of RESTful APIs using REST-assured, a Java domain-specific language that simplifies testing of REST-based services. The tests are written using Cucumber, a BDD framework, allowing non-technical stakeholders to understand the tests easily.

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project building.
- **REST-assured**: Used for testing RESTful APIs.
- **Cucumber**: BDD framework for writing test cases in plain English.
- **JUnit**: Used alongside Cucumber for asserting test outcomes.
- **Gson**: Utilized for JSON data manipulation.
- **Log4j2**: Used for logging test actions and outcomes.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java`
  - `com.testing.api`
    - `models`: Contains POJOs that represent the data structure of API resources.
    - `requests`: Contains classes responsible for sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
    - `utils`: Utility classes, including JSON file readers and other helpers.
- `src/main/resources`
  - `data`: Contains JSON files used for seeding and mocking API responses during testing.
- `src/test/java`
  - `com.testing.api`
    - `runner`: Contains Cucumber runner classes that configure and initiate the tests.
    - `stepDefinitions`: Contains step definition classes that map the steps defined in feature files to executable code.
- `src/test/resources`
  - `features`: Contains Cucumber feature files that describe the test scenarios in Gherkin syntax.
  - `schemas`: Contains JSON schema files used to validate the structure of API responses.
- `log4j2.properties`: Configuration file for Log4j2.

## Key Implementations

### Test Cases

1. **Change the Phone Number of the First Client Named Laura**
   - **File**: `client_testing_crud.feature`
   - **Description**: Tests changing the phone number of the first client named Laura, ensuring that the updated phone number is different from the original, and validating the response structure and status.

2. **Get the List of Active Resources and Update Them to Inactive**
   - **File**: `resource_testing_crud.feature`
   - **Description**: Identifies all active resources and updates them to inactive, verifying the update operation through response status and schema validation.

3. **Update and Delete a New Client**
   - **File**: `client_testing_crud.feature`
   - **Description**: Involves creating a new client, updating their details, and then deleting the client, with verifications for response status, schema, and data correctness post-update.

4. **Update the Last Created Resource**
   - **File**: `resource_testing_crud.feature`
   - **Description**: Focuses on finding the last created resource, updating all its parameters, and ensuring the updates are reflected correctly in the response data along with standard response validations.

Each of these test cases is designed to ensure flexibility and maintainability, suited for future changes in endpoints or test data, and structured to run automatically and independently without errors. The source code follows best coding practices, including proper use of Git Repository, README documentation, and JavaDoc where appropriate.

### Utilities

- `JsonFileReader`: Used for reading and parsing JSON files from the `data` directory to seed tests with expected data or mock responses.
- `HttpClientHelper`: Wraps REST-assured calls and commonly used setup configurations for API requests.

### Configuration and Setup

- **Maven Dependencies**: All dependencies are managed in the `pom.xml`. This includes libraries like REST-assured, Cucumber, Gson, and Log4j2.
- **Cucumber Configurations**: Configured in the runner classes using annotations to define feature paths, glue code locations, and report generation.

## Running Tests

Tests can be executed from the command line using Maven:

```bash
mvn test

```
